# expo-rn-meetup

Companion repo for the presentation I gave at the React Native Meetup on September 26, 2024 in Berlin.

Slides are based on the [Svelte reveal.js](https://github.com/micheleb/svelte-revealjs-slides-template) slides template I created based on [Create Beautiful Presentations With Svelte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67lqa5kTQkA) by [Joy of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev), with a few additions.

## See the slides

Clone the repo, then run

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev --open
```

(if you don't have `pnpm`, install it following [these instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation))
